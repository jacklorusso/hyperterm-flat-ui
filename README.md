# Flat UI Color theme for HyperTerm

[HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org) theme based on [Panda's Flat Ui Colors](http://flatuicolors.com/). Forked from @mdo's [Atom One Dark for HyperTerm](https://github.com/mdo/hyperterm-atom-dark), originally inspired by @jxnblk, and modified by @lol-russo. Thanks @mdo and @jxnblk!

### Install

1. Open HyperTerm's preferences with `Cmd+,` (or manually at `~/.hyperterm.js`) with your editor.
2. Update your list of plugins to include `hyperterm-flat-ui`, like so:

```js
plugins: [
'hyperterm-flat-ui'
],
```
3. Fully reload HyperTerm (`Cmd+Shift+R`), and tada!
